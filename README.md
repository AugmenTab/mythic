# Mythic for Foundry

An unofficial system implementation for playing the fan-made [Halo: Mythic](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloMythic/) tabletop roleplaying game on [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/).

This system (once complete) provides character sheet support for various Actor and Item types, mechanical support for dice and rules necessary to play games of Mythic 6.0. Coming soon will be compendium content for the Bestiary, the Flood, and all in-game items.

You can find video guides on how to install and use Mythic for Foundry [on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeJTbB--c7R3tkFoFiC145CT_ykJ-FdsP).

## Installation

The latest version of the Mythic for Foundry system can be installed using the manifest. On the Foundry VTT home page ("Configuration and Setup"), navigate to the "Game Systems" tab. Select "Install System," and provide the following link as the Manifest URL:
* [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AugmenTab/mythic/main/system.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AugmenTab/mythic/main/system.json)

Any current or prior version can also be installed manually. You must clone or extract the system files to your `Data/systems/mythic` folder. Archives of all editions can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/AugmenTab/mythic/releases).

Always remember to back up your world files before updating.

## Features

The following is a list of features offered by Mythic for Foundry.

### Actors

All available Actor types in this system.

* **Named Character:** The primary Actor type for player characters, NPCs, and special Nemesis enemies. Nearly every aspect of this character sheet can be customized to fine-tune exacting stat requirements.
* **Bestiary Character**: The Actor type representing all unnamed mooks in the game, pulled from the Bestiary. These are made to be generic boilerplate templates for enemies that can be rolled from and adjusted quickly so as to represent a variety of similar enemies.
* **Flood**: An Actor type specifically for the Flood Bestiary, playing to their unique strengths and offers multiple avenues of adjustment for stats and swarm sizes.
* **Vehicle**: The Actor type for vehicles, permitting them to own items and weapons that can be swapped out to represent different configurations without requiring different sheets.

### Items

All available Item types in this system.

* **Ability:** All purchasable abilities, as well as abilities unique to particular races or soldier types, traits, and augmentations.
* **Armor:** All wearable protective armor suits available in the game.
* **Education:** All purchasable educations.
* **Equipment:** All other items that don't fall into any other category are represented by this item type.
* **Weapon:** Anything that requires a to-hit roll or deals damage can be made into a weapon, which can be rolled from the owner's sheet to make attacks and post informative messages about the item to chat. Weapons come in three main categories: Ranged, Melee, and Thrown.

### Compendia
