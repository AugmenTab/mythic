# Mythic 4.x for Foundry

An unofficial system implementation for playing the fan-made [Halo: Mythic](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloMythic/) tabletop roleplaying game on [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/).

This system (once complete) provides character sheet support for various Actor and Item types, mechanical support for dice and rules necessary to play games of Mythic 4.0 and later. Coming soon will be compendium content for the Bestiary, the Flood, and all in-game items.

## Installation

Coming soon!

## Features

The following is a list of features offered by Mythic for Foundry.

### Actors

All available Actor types in this system. Unimplemented items are *italicized*.

* Named Character: The primary Actor type for player characters, NPCs, and special Nemesis enemies. Nearly every aspect of this character sheet can be customized to fine-tune exacting stat requirements.
* *Bestiary Character*: The Actor type representing all unnamed mooks in the game, pulled from the Bestiary. These are made to be generic boilerplate templates for enemies that can be rolled from and adjusted quickly so as to represent a variety of similar enemies. **Development on this Actor type will not begin until after the release of Mythic 4.5.**
* *Flood Character*: An Actor type specifically for the Flood Bestiary, playing to their unique strengths and offers multiple avenues of adjustment for stats and swarm sizes. **Development on this Actor type will not begin until after the release of Mythic 4.5.**
* *Vehicle*: The Actor type for vehicles, permitting them to own items and weapons that can be swapped out to represent different configurations without requiring different sheets.

### Items

All available Item types in this system. Unimplemented items are *italicized*.

* Ability: All purchasable abilities, as well as abilities unique to particular races or soldier types, traits, and augmentations.
* Armor: All wearable protective armor suits available in the game.
* Education: All purchasable educations.
* Equipment: All other items that don't fall into any other category are represented by this item type.
* Weapon: Anything that requires a to-hit roll or deals damage can be made into a weapon, which can be rolled from the owner's sheet to make attacks and post informative messages about the item to chat. Weapons come in three main categories: Ranged, Melee, and Thrown.

### Compendiums

## Known Bugs

* Talents tabs do not apply active class when first clicking in from elsewhere.
* Experience Apply buttons are discarding first attempt to alter values, then work correctly afterward.
* Experience Purchase Price field does not focus coming off the Name field. It has to be focused a second time before the focus sticks.
* Equipping a new armor while one is already equipped updates the character sheet n + 1 times, where n is the number of armors the user has in their inventory. This is not so much a bug as it is a quirk of how it updates each armor in turn to unequip them before finally equipping the new armor. This may cause unforeseen issues, but as of yet none have been observed. In the future, I would like to batch these changes, then update them all at once.
* Armor only calculates values when attached to a character.

## Planned Features and Stretch Goals

* Compendiums as laid out above.
* Tooltips for everything.
* Special Damage.
* Fully functioning Medical page to handle injuries.
* Add called shots, Clear Target, and Precision Strike.
* Add hit locations for targeting vehicles.
* Add dual wielding.
* Lock nav bar & inventory bar at the top of the Actor Sheet.
* Ability to add custom skills.
* Special ammo builder for weapons, with stats and cost automatically applied to the weapon.
