Learning proper medical skills takes time, so the GM may choose how long it will take. An effective time to allow Characters to learn the Medical Skill is between missions when the Characters have downtime.</p>\n<p>A character with the Medication Skill can diagnose symptoms, apply first aid, and reduce a Character's Wounds and Fatigue.</p>\n<p>This Skill relies heavily on Medical Tools. Surgeries cannot be done without the proper tools, wounds cannot be bandaged without bandages or cloth, and medication cannot be given if it is not owned.</p>\n<h2>First Aid</h2>\n<p>The Medication Skill can be used to perform First Aid Actions, which are Extended Actions. There are two types of First Aid: Fatigue Aid and Wound Aid. These Actions can only be taken if the Character has a Medical Kit and the Medication Skill at Trained, or better. No Skill Test is needed.</p>\n<p>Fatigue Aid reduces Fatigue by 1 level for every minute of the First Aid Action that's given. When used with Fatigue lowering Medical Equipment, the Medic adds half their Intellect Modifier to the Fatigue lowered.</p>\n<p>Wound Aid removes Wounds by 1 per every hour of First Aid Action that's given. The Medic may use Biofoam alongside this and increase the Biofoam's healing by half their Intellect Modifier per use. This does not count as the Extended Medical Test needed to allow the patient to begin healing normally and does not reset the uses of Biofoam the Character may receive.</p>\n<p>When given proper equipment, the Medic may have multiple patients at a time that they give these First Aid Extended Actions to. A Character giving First Aid may have up to their Intellect Modifier in Patients that they tend to at a time, without increasing how long it takes to care for everyone involved.</p>\n<h2>Diagnoses</h2>\n<p>With a successful Medication Skill Test, a Medic can diagnose a disease or medical issue. The GM can alter the difficulty of the test for different situations. If a bullet wound causes the issue, it would be a Simple Medical Test. A well known disease could be a +20. The GM may come up with the Difficulty Modifier needed to pass the Diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Each time a Character makes a proper Diagnosis, the next time they come across the same medical issue, they gain a stacking +10 Bonus. Once the character would reach +40 to their Diagnosis Test, they are considered to pass the test automatically.</p>\n<h2>Extended Medical Test</h2>\n<p>The Medication Skill and a Medical Kit is needed to do an Extended Medical Test, where the Character cares for their patient to hasten their healing process and recover from the usage of various drugs, such as Biofoam. Extended Medical Tests take 4 Hours, but is reduced by 1 hour per Degree of Success on a Medication Test, to a minimum of 1. Degrees of Failure will each add an etra 30 Minutes onto the Action.</p>\n<p>The Character who receives an Extended Medical Test will have their natural healing increased. Every 24 hours, the Character will heal their Toughness Modifier worth of Wounds. The Medication Test also increases the number of wounds healed on the first day by the amount of Degrees of Success the Medic rolled.</p>\n<p>Characters who receive Extended Medical Tests will continue to receive them each day, up to the Medic's Intellect Modifier in days, but only if they rest. Characters who take actions such as Charge, Run, or Full Actions of Attacks will lose the next following days of the Extended Medical Test.</p>\n<h2>Alien Biology</h2>\n<p>There are many races, most of which share a completely alien biology compared to each other.

Not all actions can have a ton of Characters assisting. For example, a GM should only allow up to 3 Characters assisting in changing or repairing a tank tread. The GM should discuss with the players how a Character is assisting before allowing the time reduction.</p>\n<p>For every Character assisting with a Repair, the Repair time is divided by that much. For example, a 20 minute process with two Characters will only take 10 minutes, but with 3 Characters, it would take 7 minutes.</p>"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"an9AAnyv69VtBEmg":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ZDkps5z5OAHybthb"}},"_id":"AmeMdeVqWRApubOs"}
