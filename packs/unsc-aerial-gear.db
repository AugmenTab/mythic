Commonly considered to be the safest kind of chute, the Falcon Wing consists of a light pack with a black chute inside, and two straps the wearer can use to maneuver to their target at a +20 Bonus. The Falcon Wing has a carrying capacity of 480 kg, including its own weight, and is ideal for atmospheric operations. The chute has integrity of 40, reducing this to 20 only halves falling damage. At 0, the Falcon Wing is destroyed, and the wearer takes falling damage as normal.

The pack uses a variety of foils, heat-sinks and chutes to safely bring a pilot from orbit to the ground. The Reentry pack can decelerate a large amount of weight, up to 750kg, not counting its own weight, enough to deliver even a SPARTAN in armor to the ground safely. The M-Spec, being an emergency device, is not intended to drop soldiers with their equipment, but does have a special holster to hold a Sidearm securely without losing it in the drop. The Reentry Pack can only be used with Vacuum sealed gear, such as MJOLNIR.","price":{"base":25,"mods":0,"total":25},"trainings":{"equipment":"","faction":"unsc"},"weight":{"carried":false,"each":25,"equipped":false,"felt":0,"quantity":1,"selfSupported":false,"total":25}},"type":"equipment"}

Parafoils use a collapsible “foil”, like a glider, made of resilient metals to allow it to carry heavy loads safely to the ground. The Parafoil can be used to insert from Low Orbit or Atmosphere. The Parafoil has a carrying capacity of 730 kg, including its own weight. Deployment of a Parafoil reduces all falling damage a character takes to zero so long as it is opened at or above 60 meters from the ground. The Parafoil has an integrity of 10, though reducing this to 0 only compromises it, causing it to half whatever falling damage is rolled against the wearer. At double its Integrity, the Parafoil is destroyed, and the wearer takes falling damage as normal.
